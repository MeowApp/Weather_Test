# Weather_Test

This is an Android Weather Application created for Appcelerator code challenge.

The main function is to get the current location's weather condition and one week forecast using OpenWeatherMap API based on Android device location. 

It has been tested working on real Android devices with differenet API level and different screen density. It might have problem of getting the location on some virtual device of earlier API levels, which caused by a Google API client out of date.
And for a brand new virtual device please enter the Google Map Application to make sure the Google Location service and GoogleApiClient is properly set up. In the case the device couldn't find its location, the default city Singapore weather will be displayed.

For any questions please feel free to contact me. Thank you
